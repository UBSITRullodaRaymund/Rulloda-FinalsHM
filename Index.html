                A TIMELINE OF MY LIFE
            </h1>
            <ul>
                <li><b>2003</b> - Many parents are surprised to see how alert a newborn can be this year. A newborn's eyes are open quite a bit immediately after birth, and babies spend a lot of time studying faces, particularly their parents'. The sound of your voices may cause your baby to turn or react. Your baby, like me, is using all of his or her senses, including smell and touch, to identify with and become attached to you.

                </li><br>
                <li><b>2006</b> - I anticipate a lot of emotional expressions, new friendships, pretend play, an interest in numbers, tall stories, a lot of physical activity, and other things at this age. Reading, creative play, inside and outside play, turn-taking games, and cooking are all developmental activities.

                </li><br>
                <li><b>2009</b> - It was a wonderful experience to be 7-year-old me. It's like entering the middle school years. This means that I am still reliant on my parents for many things, but I am also becoming more self-sufficient. I was a social person who craved friendships with my parents' peers but was also content to spend time with their parents. Some refer to this period as my parents' "sweet spot."

                </li><br>
                <li><b>2011</b> - I find myself having lengthy, detailed discussions about saving the whales or whether an extra day should be added to the weekend. I'm happy and proud to see you becoming more thoughtful about these issues, but I'm also a little overwhelmed by their passionate discussions about them.

                </li><br>
                <li><b>2014</b> - This is a time of many physical, mental, emotional, and social changes. Hormones change as puberty begins. Most boys grow facial and pubic hair and their voices deepen. Most girls grow pubic hair and breasts, and start their period. They might be worried about these changes and how they are looked at by others. This also will be a time when your teen might face peer pressure to use alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs, and to have sex. Other challenges can be eating disorders, depression, and family problems. At this age, teens make more of their own choices about friends, sports, studying, and school. They become more independent, with their own personality and interests, although parents are still very important.

                </li><br>
                <li><b>2018</b> - For most teenagers, turning 16 is a big deal. Not only does having a driver's license increase our freedom, but it also makes us more aware of what they want us to do in the future. Those planning to attend college may be visiting universities like mine or studying for standardized tests.

                </li><br>
                <li><b>2022</b> - I couldn't wait to turn 18 when I was a teenager. It seemed like it took an eternity to reach majority. However, you will reach the age of 18 and will be able to make your own decisions in life. With all of the new liberties and rights comes a great deal of responsibility. A sense of ownership over yourself, your life, and what you make of it. When you're 18, you have to make a lot of decisions that will affect the rest of your life.
